This plugin implements a Flattr shortcode. It comes with its own options page under the Settings menu and has been translated into French.


== Description ==

This plugin adds a "flattr" shortcode to your WordPress installation.

You can use it like this:

[flattr]
[flattr tag="video games, video, Halo"]
[flattr cat="video"]

Or with all parameters specified:

[flattr btn="compact|large" tle="<your title>" dsc="<your description" cat=<the category of your thing> lng="<the language of your thing> tag="<your tags>" url="<the URL of your thing>" hide="true|false"]

To learn what each attribute entails, please refer to the following list:

btn - (Optional) This is the type of button you would like to display. To get the compact button use 'compact' otherwise the default (large) button is displayed. (When using the compact button its best to place this parameter first as the button then will be compact even if the later parameters messes up something.)

tle - This is the title of the thing you want to submit. This is typically the title of your blog entry or software name.

dsc - This is the full excerpt of the content. Some blog text or information about your song you've written or so forth.

cat - This is the flattr category the content belongs to. You can choose between the following: text, images, video, audio, software, rest.

lng - Language of the submitted thing.

tag - (Optional) This is the tags of the thing, to help people finding your content easier on the Flattr website. If you want to use multiple tags, separate using a normal comma (,) sign.

url - (Optional) This is the URL of the thing, if this is not always the same on your site. Maybe you have multiple domains with the same content. This is to lock the content to always be recognized as the same content for Flattr.

hide - (Optional) Use this to hide the thing from listings on flattr.com. The value 'true' will hide the thing.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you make it? =

I am learning about WordPress plugins and how to develop them.
Flattr is an excellent idea and so...this plugin was born.

= What's coming next? =

A future version could include Twitter-integration, to notify your followers when you Flattr a thing.
Being able to receive events from the Flattr frame would make that possible, but using the upcoming REST API might work better.
